      <h1>There's something about the way</h1>
      <p>letters look when they are beside one another,</p>
      <p>the way words take shape by their <strong>being</strong> beside one another,</p>
      <p>and how, by words, we are able to do, create, and say so much with little more than the stroke of a pen.</p>
      <p>I graduated Anderson University with a degree in English Creative Writing and, ever since, all I've ever wanted has been to</p>
      <p>adapt the flexibility of the words we use to build unique and memorable things.</p>

      <h1>That's why I do what I do.</h1>
      <p>Web Development is, in its truest sense, the beauty of what letter after letter,</p>
      <p>word after word, laid end to end,</p>
      <p>is capable of creating.</p>

          <h2 class="skilltitle">Front End Development</h2>
          <p>Using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, I build quick and engaging websites, capable of representing something as large as your business or as important as your individual brand.</p>

      <h2>Robinson Painting Company</h2>
      <p>Robinson Painting Co. is a business in upstate South Carolina that specializes in home and commercial, interior and exterior painting, as well as a handful of other repair and restoration services. The business, at the moment, only has a FaceBook page to advertise their work, but I decided to take it upon myself to mockup a website for them. That being said, the structure of the website and the words on it do not necessarily represent the style or views of the company, but rather are choices I made and words I chose that I best believed would capture the tone of what they are doing. The photos are the property of <a href="https://www.rhythmandash.com">Rhythm and Ash Photography.</a> You can see the mockup I did <a href="robinson.html">right here</a> and their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/robinsonpaintingco/">official FaceBook page here</a>.</p>

      <h2>The Harbored and Homesick</h2>
      <p>The Harbored and Homesick is a blog I began in the fall of 2015. It isn't focused on any one facet of my life, but rather all of them; it acts as a space where I can share not only my thoughts, but specific moments of my life and the lives of others. Sometimes I write about politics, or pop culture, sometimes a social issue or two, and sometimes what I write about is as simple as a video game. Or my dog. You can read my many posts <a href="https://harboredandhomesick.wordpress.com">here</a></p>
      <h2>Lined Paper Lamppost</h2>
      <p>Lined Paper Lamppost is a webcomic I worked on for a year a half before publishing it in spring of 2016; it ran for just over one year before ending. It's a story about change, about friendships and growing older, with small towns, coffee shops and a ghost or two thrown in for good measure. You can view it in its entirety right <a href="http://lplthecomic.com">here</a></p>
