# portfolio-1.0
This is the first iteration of my developer portfolio made summer/fall of 2017.

The portfolio is designed to be responsive and minimal, focusing on a few key design features as opposed to EVERYTHING in the toolbox. It all is laid out in a single page scroll and every section is set up to alternate with the section that came before it.

Not only is the portfolio featured, but a second "project example" website is nested within it, and linked to within the webpage. 

Note: as of the upload, there are small bugs with scaling that have yet to be resolved.
